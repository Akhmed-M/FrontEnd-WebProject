# FrontEnd-WebProject
* This project was our 2nd year university project, which was made by using no frameworks at all.
* My personal contribution to the project is the `Cart` page, and the `local storage` part of the `light/dark mode` that exists in all pages.
* Note that ***Javascript*** was my main focus in this project, not the design.
